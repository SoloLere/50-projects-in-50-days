## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- JavaScript


### What I learned

- The :valid CSS pseudo-class represents any input or other form element whose contents validate successfully. This allows to easily make valid fields adopt an appearance that helps the user confirm that their data is formatted properly.
```css
.form-control input:valid + label span {
    color: lightblue;
    transform: translateY(-30px);
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
