## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

With my DSA knowledge, I was able to save time in the JS code. I used the last_active to save O(N) time required by remove_active function. â˜º

```js
const panels = document.querySelectorAll(".panel");

let last_active = panels[0];

panels.forEach((panel) => {
  panel.addEventListener("click", () => {
    last_active.classList.remove("active");
    panel.classList.add("active");
    last_active = panel;
  });
});
```

```js
panels.forEach((panel) => {
  panel.addEventListener("click", () => {
    removeActiveClasses();
    panel.classList.add("active");
  });
});

function removeActiveClasses() {
  panels.forEach((panel) => {
    panel.classList.remove("active");
  });
}
```
