## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- JavaScript


### What I learned

- The white-space CSS property sets how white space inside an element is handled. Adding a nowrap value suppresses line break.
  
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  white-space: nowrap;
}
```
- Learnt new mouse events, mouseover and mouseleave, which behaves like hovering.
  
```js
right.addEventListener("mouseover", () => container.classList.add("hover-right"));
right.addEventListener("mouseleave", () => container.classList.remove("hover-right"));
```
