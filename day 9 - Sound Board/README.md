## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript

### What I learned

- The <audio> HTML element is used to embed sound content in documents

```html
<audio id="applause" src="sounds/applause.mp3"></audio>
```
- Some JS events that can be triggered on audio files include 

```js
 song.puase()
 song.play()
 song.currentTime() // used to get/change the time of the playing auido
```

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) - This helped me understand how to work with HTML Audio. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
