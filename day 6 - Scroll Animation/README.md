### What I learned

- The getBoundingClientRect() method returned value is a DOMRect object which is the smallest rectangle which contains the entire element, including its padding and border-width. The left, top, right, bottom, x, y, width, and height properties describe the position and size of the overall rectangle in pixels.

```js
element.getBoundingClientRect();
```
